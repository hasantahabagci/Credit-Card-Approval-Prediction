Our project, ”Credit Card Approval Prediction”, aims to revolutionize the credit approval process by developing a predictive model that enhances accuracy, fairness, and efficiency. We will leverage a diverse dataset to train and test our models while implementing fairness-aware techniques. This project, outlined in this proposal, provides a comprehensive methodology, evaluation methods, and a GitHub repository, fostering collaboration and progress tracking. With a team of dedicated members, we are committed to making regular commits and ensuring transparency throughout the project. The successful execution of this project has the potential to significantly impact individuals seeking credit and the financial institutions making lending decisions.
